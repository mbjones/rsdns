RS DNS Tools
============

Rackspace provides a [distributed DNS service](http://docs.rackspace.com/cdns/api/v1.0/cdns-devguide/content/overview.html) 
with a REST API for accessing and modifying zone information.  RS DNS Tools is a simple set of utility shell scripts for 
manipulating a Rackspace-managed DNS zone.  At this point, these scripts were developed solely to make it easier for me 
to automate some tasks, but they may be useful to others.  Have at it. Contributions including code, bug reports, and 
feedback are all welcome.
